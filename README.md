# Takeout Toolkit 🧰
**Local-first pipelines for cleaning, transforming, and exploring your exported data**

Takeout Toolkit is a modular collection of **Python-based pipelines** for processing data exports from major platforms like **Gmail, Google Search, Facebook, and ChatGPT**.

It is designed for people who want to:
- Own their data
- Work offline
- Avoid cloud lock-in
- Turn raw exports into something **readable, explorable, and human-scale**

This is not a black-box dashboard.
It is a **toolkit**.

---

## ✨ What This Is

- A set of **scripted pipelines** that transform messy export files into clean, structured outputs
- A **local-first** workflow (no servers, no uploads, no accounts)
- Designed for **archival, analysis, personal knowledge, and creative reuse**
- Built to be **inspectable, hackable, and remixable**

You can run one pipeline or many.
You can stop at CSVs or launch a local visual explorer.

---

## 🚫 What This Is Not

- ❌ A hosted SaaS
- ❌ A surveillance or analytics product
- ❌ A single monolithic app
- ❌ A replacement for the original platforms

Your data stays on *your* machine, always.

Each platform lives in its **own self-contained pipeline**.

## 🔌 Supported Pipelines

### 📧 Gmail
- Parses `.mbox` exports
- Extracts headers, metadata, and message structure
- Outputs CSV/JSON suitable for filtering, timelines, and stats

### 🔍 Google Search
- Processes Takeout search history
- Normalizes timestamps and queries
- Produces clean JSON and CSV datasets

### 📘 Facebook
- Parses Timeline HTML exports
- Filters automated app/game posts
- Extracts posts, timestamps, text, and metadata

### 🤖 ChatGPT
- Processes `conversations.json`
- Handles sparse and null nodes safely
- Outputs structured conversation data for analysis or visualization

---

## ▶️ How It Works (High Level)

1. You download your data using **Google Takeout** or platform export tools
2. You point a pipeline at the exported file(s)
3. The pipeline:
   - Validates input
   - Runs scripts in the correct order
   - Writes clean outputs to an `output/` directory
4. (Optional) You launch a **local visual explorer** for browsing the results

---

## 🧪 Example: Running a Pipeline

```bash
cd Python/Gmail
python run_pipeline.py --mbox ~/Downloads/mail.mbox
```

Each pipeline provides:
- `--help` text
- Sensible defaults
- Optional flags for filtering and output control

---

## 📊 Outputs

Depending on the pipeline, outputs may include:
- CSV files (for spreadsheets, pandas, or databases)
- JSON files (for web apps and visualizations)
- Intermediate artifacts (optional, for debugging)

All outputs are **plain files**, not databases.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- **Local-first** – no network required
- **Readable over clever** – clarity beats compression
- **Composable** – pipelines are building blocks, not endpoints
- **Archival-friendly** – outputs should still make sense in 10+ years

This toolkit is meant to age well.

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Safety

- No telemetry
- No tracking
- No uploads
- No credentials required

If you can run Python locally, you can use this.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Standard libraries + a small set of well-known dependencies
  (listed per-pipeline)

Each pipeline documents its own requirements.

---

## 🧩 Who This Is For

- People exploring their digital history
- Writers, artists, and researchers
- Archivists and digital preservation nerds
- Anyone who believes *your data should be legible to you*

## 🧭 Status

This project is **actively evolving**.
Pipelines may change as formats change.

Expect iteration, not abandonment.

---

## 💬 Notes

If something feels clunky, that’s a signal — not a failure.
This toolkit is meant to be shaped to fit *your* data and *your* questions.

Fork it. Break it. Make it yours.
